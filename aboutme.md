My name is Isabelle Hoxha, and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Paris-Saclay, France (don't get excited, the lab I work in is in fact located an hour away from Paris in public transport). 

My PhD topic is "Neurocognitive mechanisms of perceptual anticipation in decision-making". I am interested in studying human brain signals, using EEG, related to anticipatory processes, as well as building theories on the emergence of anticipation and its behavioral consequences. In summary, my research is both empirical and theoretical. Started in October 2020, I plan to graduate (and get my PhD in Psychology) by October 2023.

Scientific outreach is extremely important to me. I took part in particular in the French edition of the 3-minute thesis contest, and made it to the national finals. You can see my presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPHmninnrLI). Thanks to this experience, I have been invited to talk about my research in Spanish at Radio France International, and am excited for future communication opportunities. If you have an outreach project, don't hesitate to reach out.
