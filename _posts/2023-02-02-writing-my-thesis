After so many PhD students before me saying "uf, the writing part of the thesis is the worst!", I decided to try it out myself :o) 

Earlier this week I handed in the first chapter of my dissertation to my supervisors, and I have to say, it is not as bad as I anticipated, although I can see how one can struggle with it (and how I certainly will in the next months).

For now, my plan is to submit my thesis by mid-May for a defense between July and September 2023. In the mean time, I am also polishing some articles (stay tuned!), planning my post-PhD life, and continuing my side projects (science and not-science related).
I am open to job opportunities, so do not forget to look at my CV before leaving, send me an email, and let's discuss!
