tl;dr: I created a non-linear model of decision-making where the rate of evidence accumulation at each time depends on the starting point. We showed that it fits data better than the DDM, that it is computationally simpler than other non-linear models (like OU processes) and that it could account for other effects, such as time that passes, in a more efficient way than the DDM.

tl;dr (shorter): my covid side project is now published and can be found here: (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32841-9)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32841-9]
